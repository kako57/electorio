# Electorio

A simple voting smart contract built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

It's not the best voting smart contract, but it is a smart contract that allows you to vote.

We recommend using Uniblock to create wallets and interact with the smart contract.

Try it out yourself by running the following commands:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
